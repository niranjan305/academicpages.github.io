I am Ph.D. candidate at UC Riverside working on developing and utilizing computational tools to study, understand and rationally design complex materials, systems and processes. I am specifically interested in understanding the light-matter interactions in nanomaterials to design better light-harvesting systems, faster data transmission systems and accurate chemical sensors. I am also interested in applying first-principles calculations for predicting electronic properties of biological and chemical systems.
