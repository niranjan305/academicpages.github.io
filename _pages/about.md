My name is Niranjan Ilawe. I work as a Product Engineer at <font color="red">Illumina Inc.</font>, helping make data driven product health and process improvement decisions. I also create statistical and data analysis tools to troubleshoot and predict product/process non-conformances.

I have a Ph.D. in Chemical and Environmental Engineering from <font color="red">UC Riverside</font> with research experience in computational chemistry and quantum physics. My thesis was titled "Probing Electronic and Optical Properties of Complex Chemical and Material Systems"

I am interested in developing and utilizing computational tools and machine learning algorithms to study, and understand complex systems, processes and materials. I am especially interested in the genetics, biology and human-health related applications.

I want to utilize my programming skills, engineering knowledge and research experience to solve / simplify real-world industry problems.
