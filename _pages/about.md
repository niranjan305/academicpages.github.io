My name is Niranjan Ilawe. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Chemical and Environmental Engineering from <font color="red">UC Riverside</font> in June of 2018. 

I am interested in developing and utilizing computational tools and machine learning algorithms to study, understand and rationally design complex materials, systems and processes. 

I also have more than 4 years of industry experience in all aspects of process engineering including technology evaluation, preliminary cost analysis, process design, process optimization, erection, commissioning and project management.

I want to utilize my programming skills, engineering knowledge and research experience to solve / simplify real-world industry problems.
