I am Ph.D. candidate at <font color="red">UC Riverside</font> in the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering. 

I am interested in developing and utilizing computational tools to study, understand and rationally design complex materials, systems and processes. I also have more than 4 years of industry experience in all aspects of process engineering including technology evaluation, preliminary cost analysis, process design, process optimization, erection, commissioning and project management.

I am specifically interested in understanding the light-matter interactions in nanomaterials to design better light-harvesting systems, faster data transmission systems and accurate chemical sensors. I am also interested in applying first-principles calculations for predicting electronic properties of biological and chemical systems.
