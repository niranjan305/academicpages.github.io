Can we predict price of diamonds, given some parameters?
Here I apply some basic data analysis tools and use some regression models such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines,
and Decision Trees to analyze the diamonds data.
The diamonds dataset was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds">Kaggle</a>.<br/>
I used python, pandas, and sklearn for the analysis. 
Details of which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/niranjan305/diamonds">github</a> account.<br/>
