Can we predict price of diamonds, given some parameters? <br/>
Here I apply some basic data analysis tools and use some supervised learning methods such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines,
and Decision Trees to analyze the diamonds data.<br/>
The diamonds dataset was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds">Kaggle</a>.<br/>
I used python, pandas, and sklearn for the analysis. 
Details of which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/niranjan305/diamonds">github</a> account.<br/>
