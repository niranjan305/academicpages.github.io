This graph shows the average rainfall in each of the districts of India, over a period of 12 months.
The rainfall data was obtained from <a href="https://data.gov.in">Open Government Data Platform</a> website.<br/>
I used python, pandas, and Basemap to create the graph. Details of which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/niranjan305/india-rain-map">github</a> account.<br/>
